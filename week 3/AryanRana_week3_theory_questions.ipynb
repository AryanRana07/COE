How is the implementation of OOPS different in Python compared to Java and C++?\n","\n","In Python, you don't need to explicitly define access modifiers like public, private, or protected. Instead, Python uses naming conventions to indicate the level of accessibility. For example, attributes or methods starting with an underscore _ are considered as internal use or conventionally private.\n","\n","Python supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one base class. On the other hand, both Java and C++ support single inheritance as well as multiple inheritance.\n","\n","In Python, method overriding is achieved by defining a method with the same name in the derived class. The method in the derived class overrides the implementation of the same method in the base class. In Java and C++, you need to explicitly use the @Override annotation or the virtual keyword respectively to indicate method overriding.\n","\n","All three languages support polymorphism, but Python achieves it through dynamic typing. Python allows objects of different types to be used interchangeably as long as they support the required methods or attributes.\n","\n","Python does not have a built-in interface construct, but it can be emulated using abstract base classes from the abc module or through duck typing.\n","\n","Python allows operator overloading by defining special methods, such as __add__, __sub__, etc., for corresponding operators. In Java and C++, operator overloading is not directly supported.\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r69j1XwXBQXx"},"source":["### 2. Does python support method overloading inside a class?\n","\n","No, Python does not support method overloading. In Python, you cannot define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types, as it is not natively supported."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PSne0Z_iBQXy"},"source":["### 3. How to make a method static in Python?\n","\n","By using the '@staticmethod' decorator. The '@staticmethod' decorator is a built-in decorator that marks a method as a static method, which means it can be called on the class itself without requiring an instance of the class. "]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GtsP2J-bBQXy"},"source":["### 4. Can we do constructor overloading in Python?\n","\n","In Python, a class can have only one '___init__()' method, which serves as the constructor. Each instance of the class is initialized using this single constructor.\n","\n","However, you can achieve constructor overloading-like behavior in Python by using default argument values or class methods."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t9ThyyVwBQXy"},"source":["### 7. Which of the following statements is true?\n","a) A non-private method in a superclass can be overridden\n","b) A subclass method can be overridden by the superclass\n","c) A private method in a superclass can be overridden\n","d) Overriding isn’t possible in Python\n","\n","The correct statement is: a) A non-private method in a superclass can be overridden.\n","\n","\n","### 8. Difference in time complexity between collections.deque and list in python\n","\n","The 'collections.deque' (double-ended queue) data structure provides faster append and pop operations at both ends, making it more efficient for queue-like operations. On the other hand, 'list' operations like random access by index and insertion/deletion in the middle have better performance compared to 'deque'. Overall, the time complexity for most common operations is similar between the two data structures, which is O(1) for append/pop at the ends and O(n) for random access, insertion, and deletion in the middle.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 9. How Will You Explain Reindexing In Pandas?\n","\n","Reindexing in Pandas refers to the process of creating a new DataFrame or Series with a new index. It involves rearranging the existing data according to the new index labels. Reindexing can be performed using the reindex method in Pandas, which allows you to specify the new index labels and the desired behavior for handling missing values.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 10. How to get all 2D diagonals of a 3D NumPy array?\n","\n","To get all 2D diagonals of a 3D NumPy array, you can use the 'np.diagonal()' function along with a loop over the third dimension of the array. \n","\n","\n","\n","### 11. NumPy – Fibonacci Series using Binet Formula\n","\n","Using the Binet formula in NumPy. The Binet formula states that the n-th Fibonacci number (F(n)) can be calculated using the formula:\n","F(n) = ((phin) - (-phi)(-n)) / sqrt(5)\n","\n","where phi is the golden ratio, approximately equal to (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sfdzsEg3BQXz"},"source":["### 12.

Is multithreading in python truly parallel?\n","\n","Multithreading in Python is not truly parallel due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL is a mechanism in CPython (the reference implementation of Python) that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems. This means that multiple threads in Python cannot fully utilize multiple CPU cores simultaneously for CPU-bound tasks.\n","\n","For CPU-bound tasks that require parallel execution on multiple cores, Python provides the 'multiprocessing' module, which allows for true parallelism by spawning multiple processes instead of threads. Each process runs in a separate interpreter instance with its own memory space and can utilize multiple CPU cores."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qw53iogKBQX2"},"source":["### 14. What’s the purpose of .join()?\n","\n","It is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When called on a thread object, the '.join()' method blocks the calling thread until the target thread finishes. It is typically used to ensure that the main thread (or any other thread) waits for a specific thread to finish before proceeding with further execution."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ENaaY8YIBQX2"},"source":["### 15. Why does PyLab use a stateful interface instead of an object-oriented approach?\n","\n","PyLab is a module in the matplotlib library that provides a stateful interface to create plots and perform interactive data visualization.
